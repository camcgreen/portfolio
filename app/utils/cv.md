Dear Hiring Manager,
I am a detail driven Frontend Developer with over three years of experience based in Manchester, with an eye for what looks good.
I have worked with high profile clients to design, develop and deliver a diverse array of web apps and digital products, always with an aim to exceed expectations.
I am particularly skilled in breathing life and interactivity into interfaces with React, Next.js, Tailwind and Three.js. I focus on the frontend, though I have worked on several projects across the full-stack, as I believe it’s important to understand how all the pieces fit together.
At Voxel Studio, among various projects, I have developed a secure online training platform for a defence client and a content management system for an iPad exhibition app. This work sharpened my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS/SASS, and frameworks like React, Tailwind, Next.js, and Node.js.
Live demos of a selection of my work can be found on my portfolio, where I go into detail on how I built each project, along with the technologies I used.
COMPANY looks so exciting to work for, with projects ranging from VR to the web, and is the sort of creative environment that I am confident I would thrive in.
I get extremely excited about digital things and I hope that comes across in my work! I am hungry to solve new challenges, and learn as much as I possibly can.
I would be delighted to have an opportunity to chat with you more about upcoming projects at your company and discuss how my skills can help!
Best regards,
Cameron Green
